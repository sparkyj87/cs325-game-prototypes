<h2>Caught!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A 2-player board game with rules designed completely by me.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Timer, buttons, proximity check, animated sprites, and sound uses.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Figured out timer and its operations. 
Thought about making an AI for 1-player mode, but could not implement due to not enough time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Phaser Timer <a href="https://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.Timer.html">link</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Colored Characters <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/text/colored-characters">link</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For Each <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/groups/for-each">link</a></li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game is a variation of my Analog Assignment #1 game, which I made all the rules from scratch.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Catch the other player each with melee force field, net, or lasso.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the 'Caught!' theme provided by the professor.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input - direct mouse & keyboard inputs and clickable buttons, 
Randomness - none, 
Play styles - competitor, 
Genre: turn-based board game
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Employs area-movement and obstacle game mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The experience gained from this game is similar to that of a chess game;
more thoughts put into each move places the player closer to victory.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players can move 1 space (any 8 directions) then place an obstacle. At any point of time during their turn,
players can decide to release either a net or a lasso to catch the player, at the cost of $1. 
Players are given $3 and will lose if $0. Net requires either an obstacle or board edge
'within 3 blocks in all 4 direction around the opponent' to work. Lasso can be moved around in 4 directions, 
but it will travel all the way across the board until it runs into an obstacle or board edge of the map. Lasso can
be moved indefinitely until it catches the player, or cancelled (because of no path available). Players can destroy
anything that comes within 1 block distance, including obstacles or other player.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players need to make meaningful decisions each move to avoid being trapped by a net or hit by a lasso, by
placing obstacles and moving their pieces smartly.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
No background story is present, other than it involves two players trying to catch each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is mainly made for 10 years or older, mostly for anyone who enjoys strategy board game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 to 5 minutes
</li>

</ul>
