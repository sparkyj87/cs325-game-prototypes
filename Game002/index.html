<h2>Farm Escape</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
An elevator/bridge like obstacle concept that challenges players' quick decision-making skills.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Varied jump height, double-jump, top/bottom/sidewall touch detection, scrolling/fading text, 
multiple sprite movement control, collision
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Learned the details of jump height control as well as double-jump. 
I wanted to add popup-buff items like a rocket booster but ran out of time.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game most closely resembles the Platformer Tight example from Phaser website which 
I borrowed the code from, as well as varying jump height and Bound events codes.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Guide your chicken through the 10 levels of elevator logs that can crush you in between them.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the 'chicken' theme selected by the professor.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input-keyboard, Randomness-A lot of randomness, Play styles-achiever, Genre:playformer
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The goal is to reach level 10; each level gets harder and will require significant skills to pass.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players are expected to quickly become familiar with game mechanics. Their experiences with the game 
should be closely connected with their skills; the more skills they develop, more levels they will clear.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Player will need up, right, left keys through most of their gameplay, left and right keys move the chicken in those directions, 
and up key will make the chicken jump. Jump height can be controlled by keeping the up key pressed. Player can also press jump 
again to double-jump. If player's chicken runs in between two logs closing into each other, the chicken will get crushed and
it is game over. Each advance in stage will increase the speed and number of logs passing through the stage. 
Player's chicken will die if it falls into the bottom of screen or crushedbetween the logs. 
Pressing Enter will restart the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players can keep their chicken in the upper half of the screen to avoid falling into the pit.
Looking ahead of chicken's path is key!
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Game is set in a countryside farm. Player is a rooster that wants to escape the farm but the owner of the farm has
installed 10 layers of elevator log fences! It must navigate through the logs and past the dangers of the bottomless
pit and merciless crushing logs.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is mainly made for anyone that enjoys a fast, non-serious gameplay, most-likely from kids to young adults.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 to 3 minutes
</li>
