<h2>Hole in One</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
-Combined a golf concept with a asteroid theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
-Ship acceleration, world boundary, collision, audio and sprite uses.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
-I learned a few javascript commands as well as a bit of phaser physics. Combining different examples from Phaser website into one game was surprisingly easy. But I spent quite a bit of time trying to connect different states with no success.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Asteroids Movement: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/asteroids-movement">link</a></li>
</ul>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game most closely resembles the Asteroids Movement example from Phaser website which I borrowed the code from, as well as Group-vs-self and Sprite-vs-Sprite codes.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Guide your golf-ball through the 18 holes of mine-filled golf course.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the 'golfer' theme selected by the professor.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input used: keyboard (4 arrow keys and the space bar), genre: Arcade (flying evasion), play style: fast-paced real time movement
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
It evaluates a victory condition mechanics and is goal-based; reaching and beating the last stage, hole 18.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to experience the controls of 2D spaceship maneuvering, and the fast-paced gameplay that requires quick decision making skills.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
Player will need the 4 arrow keys through most of their gameplay, left and right keys turn player's ship, 
and up and down keys control forward and backward movement of the ship. Turning has instant acceleration, 
whereas movement has gradual acceleration. Each stage puts player's ship in the left safe-zone, 
and player will simply guide his ship to the right safe-zone to move onto the next stage. Each increase in stage 
will raise the difficulty, either by raising the speed or the number of mines. When player dies or finishes stage
18, game over message appears and the player can press the space bar to restart.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
When the mines start increasing numbers after each stage try not to wait too long for an opening, 
because some mines will gain speed by bouncing off other mines. They can move faster than player's 
ship if they gain the momentum. Also, sometimes navigating along the map edges can help dodge the mines.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Game is set in a golf course without gravity. Player character is the golf-ball that wants to survive through
the 18-hole filled with exploding mines. No backstory is provided in this game. The increasing difficulty 
represents the main tension of this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is mainly made for anyone that enjoys short, fast-paced game, most-likely from kids to young-adults.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 to 3 minutes
</li>
