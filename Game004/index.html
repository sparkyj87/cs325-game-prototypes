and up key will make the chicken jump. Jump height can be controlled by keeping the up key pressed. Player can also press jump 
again to double-jump. If player's chicken runs in between two logs closing into each other, the chicken will get crushed and
it is game over. Each advance in stage will increase the speed and number of logs passing through the stage. 
Press S key to slow down time to perform exceptional maneuvers. However, slowing down time will consume energy, which will recharge over time.
Player's chicken will die if it falls into the bottom of screen or crushed between the logs.
