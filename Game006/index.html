<h2>Tag Wars</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
-Digital version of Physical Prototype game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
-Hex board use, Sprite groups, Sounds.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
-learned how to add/remove sprite board pieces from group, angular board piece placements, sprite input priority.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Very similar to the Physical Prototype from last week.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Both players need to place hex pieces and turn their vehicles to checkmate the other player.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Urban warfare, line of sight, turn-based board game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input used: mouse, genre: Board, 
play style: chess-like
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
It assimilates the physical game, with functional ice/portal movements. Victory detection not yet implemented.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The experience gained from this game is similar to that of a chess game;
more thoughts put into each move places the player closer to victory.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Core Mechanics: shoot(not yet implemented), move, turn, place hexboard pieces.

Rules

1.
Yellow player starts in one corner as 1-direction tank, brown player starts in the opposite corner 
as 1-direction plane. 2 green hexes(upgrades) are placed at each midline corner. 
2.
Each player is distributed 5 random map pieces. Every time each player spends a piece, he can 
pick another random piece from the stack. If tank player picks up red hex, put it back and pick 
again. If plane player picks up blue hex, put it back and pick again. 
3.
Tank can move 1 space, plane can move 5 spaces. 
4.
Both tank and plane can kill each other with cannon but the tank, and only the tank, can also kill 
the plane by overrunning it. 
5.
Each turn consists of (in this order): move, set direction of vehicle, and place 1 map piece(red, 
blue, or cannon refractors). 
6.
Red hexes are portals and only works when there are at least two on the map. 
7.
Blue hexes are ice slides and gives the tank that moves onto it 1 extra movement to any distance 
in any direction from the ice slide. Multiple ice sliding is allowed. 
8.
Green hexes are consumables that allows tank/plane players to equip 2-direction cannon. 
9.
Cannon refractors cannot be removed unless replaced by red or blue hexes. 
10.
Red and blue hexes cannot be removed once placed. 
11.
Red hex (portal) can transfer the plane or cannon shot into any other portals, but cannon shots 
must retain same direction that it was shot from.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Tank player can place ice to give himself the advantage to quickly move onto the plane player. 
Plane player should try to eat both greens to prevent the tank player from getting 2-direction 
cannon. 
Plane player will need to find a way to destroy tank player as quickly as possible, because tank 
player will be at an advantage once many ice slides are placed.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Tank versus Jet in an urban city. Tank tries to shoot down/overrun the plane with speed boosts while plane
meneuvers with portals to shoot the tank down.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
kids to young adults.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5 minutes
</li>
