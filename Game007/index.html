<h2>Tag Wars</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
-Iteration on the Digital version of Physical Prototype game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
-Hex board use, Sprite groups, Sounds.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
-learned how to add/remove sprite board pieces from group, angular board piece placements, sprite input priority.
-fixed bug that overlapped board pieces.
-implemented victory detection.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Iteration to the Digital version of Physical Prototype from last week.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Both players need to place hex pieces and turn their vehicles to checkmate the other player.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Urban warfare, line of sight, turn-based board game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input used: mouse, genre: Board, 
play style: chess-like
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
It assimilates the physical game, with functional ice/portal movements. Victory detection not yet implemented.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The experience gained from this game is similar to that of a chess game;
more thoughts put into each move places the player closer to victory.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Core Mechanics: shoot(not yet implemented), move, turn, place hexboard pieces.

Rules

1.
Blue player starts in one corner as 1-direction tank, Red player starts in the opposite corner 
as 1-direction plane.
2.
Each player is distributed 5 random map pieces. Every time each player spends a piece, he can 
pick another random piece from the piece stack. If plane player picks up blue hex, put it back and pick again. 
3.
Tank can move 1 space, plane can move 4 spaces. 
4.
Both tank and plane can kill each other with cannon but the tank, and only the tank, can also kill 
the plane by overrunning it. 
5.
Each turn consists of (in this order): shoot/move(only one allowed), set direction of vehicle, and place 1 map piece(red, 
blue, or cannon refractors). 
6.
Blue hexes are ice slides and gives the tank that moves onto it 1 extra movement to any distance 
in any direction from the ice slide. Multiple ice sliding is allowed. 
9.
Cannon refractors cannot be removed unless replaced blue hexes. 
10.
Blue hexes cannot be removed once placed. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Tank player can place ice to give himself the advantage to quickly move onto the plane player. 
Plane player will need to find a way to destroy tank player as quickly as possible, because tank 
player will be at an advantage once enough ice slides are placed.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Tank versus Jet in an urban city. Tank tries to shoot down/overrun the plane with speed boosts while plane
meneuvers with portals to shoot the tank down.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
kids to young adults.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5 minutes
</li>
